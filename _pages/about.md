I'm a senior consultant and partner at K30, a leading Stavanger-based digitalization firm.

My CV is available at <strong><a href="https://cv.stian.tech/">cv.stian.tech</a></strong>

Slides from presentations and talks I have given at <strong><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stianovrevage">speakerdeck.com/stianovrevage</a></strong>

For the last 3 years I have been working on Cloud and the last 2 with Kubernetes. Before that I was in charge of operations of a small FTTH ISP for 7 years.
