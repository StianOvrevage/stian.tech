I'm a senior consultant and partner at K30, a leading Stavanger-based digitalization firm.

For the last 3 years I have been working on Cloud and the last 2 with Kubernetes. Before that I was in charge of operations of a small FTTH ISP for 7 years.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/StianOvrevage), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stianovrevage/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stian.ovrevage).
